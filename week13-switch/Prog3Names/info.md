Because string comparisons are not supported by the switch statement in C++, the program you provided will not function. The switch statement is intended to compare constant values directly when working with integral kinds, such as characters, integers, or enumerated types. Nevertheless, switch does not support the direct use of std::string objects, which are dynamically allocated and have varying sizes. Strings are more complicated data structures in C++ that need to be compared using particular techniques, like the compare() function or the == operator, which are both made to manage the character-by-character comparison required for strings. In order to properly compare string values, you must use if-else statements rather than switches when checking the value of a string.
